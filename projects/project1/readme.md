This project was developed in Python 3 using Jupyter Notebook 6.1.6 and Python libraries installed with Anaconda 4.8.3 for Windows.

## 2) Project Motivation <a class="anchor" id="motivation"></a>

The main goal of this project is to choose a dataset to explore using the CRISP-DM process (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) to get meaningful insights about data and answer some key business questions about it. Moreover, the results achieved in the previous step should be shared with the community through a Github repository and blog post.
