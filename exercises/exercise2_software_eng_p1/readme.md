## 1) Instalation <a class="anchor" id="installation"></a>

This project was developed in Python 3 using Jupyter Notebook 6.1.6 and Python libraries installed with Anaconda 4.8.3 for Windows.

## 2) Project Motivation <a class="anchor" id="motivation"></a>

The main goal of this project is to document the exercises from the Data Science Nanodegree Udacity with focus on **Class 2 - Software Engineering Practices Pt I**. The main topics taught in this lesson are:
* Refactoring code
* Tips for writing modular code
* Tips for writing efficient code
* Documentation
* Version control

## 3) File Descriptions <a class="anchor" id="file"></a>

* **Jupyter notebook files:**
    * **wine_quality.ipynb:** It renames the column from the Wine Quality Dataset and makes a feature analysis using a long and a refactorated pieces of code.
    * **common_books.ipynb:** If find the intersection of common books between to .txt datasets using numpy arrays and Python data structures.
    * **holiday_gifts.ipynb:** It optimizes a math operation with a numpy array using numpy functions instead of a for loop to calculate the total amount spent with gifts.
* **dataset:** Folder 
    * **wine_quality.csv:** [Wine Quality Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) - Containes physicochemical properties collected in test and rating by wine expers.
	* **books_published_last_two_years.txt:** It contains the code of all books published in the las two years from a bookstore.
    * **all_coding_books.txt:** It contains the code of all the coding books from a bookstore.
	* **gift_costs.txt:** It has the price of products from wihsh lists chosen by users from a gift store.

## 4) Results <a class="anchor" id="results"></a>

The detailed discussion of the data analysis can be found in the Jupyter notebook files.
